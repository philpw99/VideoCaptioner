## 🧪 Testing

Processing a 14-minute 1080P [Bilibili English TED video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1jT411X7Dz) using local Whisper model for speech recognition and `gpt-4o-mini` model for optimization and Chinese translation took approximately **4 minutes**.

Backend calculations show that model optimization and translation costs less than ¥0.01 (based on official pricing)

For specific subtitle and video synthesis test results, please refer to [TED Video Test](./test.md)

## ⚙️ Basic Configuration

### 1. LLM API Configuration (Optional)

| Configuration Item | Description |
|--------|------|
| Built-in Model | Software includes basic LLM (`gpt-4o-mini`), usable without configuration |
| API Support | Supports standard OpenAI API format. Compatible with [SiliconCloud](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/HF95kaoz), [DeepSeek](https://platform.deepseek.com/), [Ollama](https://ollama.com/blog/openai-compatibility), etc.<br>For configuration, refer to [Configuration Documentation](./docs/llm_config.md) |

Recommended models: For higher quality, consider `Claude-3.5-sonnet` or `gpt-4o`


### 2. Local Whisper Speech Recognition Configuration (Download Required in Software)

| Model | Disk Space | Memory Usage | Description |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| Tiny | 75 MiB | ~273 MB | Basic transcription, testing only |
| Small | 466 MiB | ~852 MB | Good for English recognition |
| Medium | 1.5 GiB | ~2.1 GB | Recommended minimum for Chinese recognition |
| Large-v1/v2 | 2.9 GiB | ~3.9 GB | Excellent results, recommended if hardware allows |
| Large-v3 | 2.9 GiB | ~3.9 GB | Community reports potential hallucination/subtitle repetition issues (Not actually supported) |

Note: Models can be downloaded directly within the software in China; supports both GPU and integrated graphics.


### 3. Script Matching

- The "Subtitle Optimization and Translation" page includes a "Script Matching" option supporting the following **one or more** content types to assist in subtitle correction and translation:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|------|------|
| Terminology List | Reference table for technical terms, names, specific phrases | Machine Learning->机器学习<br>Elon Musk->马斯克<br>Support->应援<br>Turing Pattern<br>Bus Paradox |

## 📝 Notes

1. The quality of subtitle segmentation is crucial for viewing experience. For this, I developed [SubtitleSpliter](https://github.com/WEIFENG2333/SubtitleSpliter), which can intelligently reorganize word-by-word subtitles into paragraphs that follow natural language habits and perfectly synchronize with video scenes.

2. During processing, only pure text content is sent to the large language model, without timeline information, which greatly reduces processing overhead.

3. In the translation phase, we adopt Andrew Ng's "translate-reflect-translate" methodology. This iterative optimization approach ensures translation accuracy.
